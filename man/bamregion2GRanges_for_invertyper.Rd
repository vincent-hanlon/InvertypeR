  bamfile,
  bamindex,
  region = NULL,
  pairedEndReads = FALSE,

a GRanges object

\description{
This replaces the StrandPhaseR function by sneakily preventing it from reading from the BAM file, but instead giving it processed GAlignments results
A list of GAlignments objects, named by BAM file name, will need to be available to this function even though it's not passed from StrandPhaseR
