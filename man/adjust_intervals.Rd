\usage{
adjust_intervals(
  inversions,
  reads,
  confidence = 0.95,
  base,
  sex = "female",
  prior,
  prior_male = c(0.5, 0.5),

}
\arguments{
\item{inversions}{A dataframe of inversions output by genotype_inversions.}

\item{reads}{A list of two Granges objects: reads from a WW composite file and a WC composite file.}

\item{confidence}{Posterior probability threshold above which you consider genotype calls to be reliable. Used to decide whether to keep adjusted inversions, as well as to identify low-confidence calls
for adjust_method "low". Default 0.95.}

\item{base}{A list output by WWCC_background().}

\item{sex}{Sex of sample to figure out sex chromosomes. Default "female".}

\item{prior}{Vector of three prior weights for inversion genotypes. For example, c("ref","het","hom") = c(0.9,0.05,0.05).}

\item{prior_male}{Vector of two prior weights for male sex chromosomes. For example, c("ref", "inv") = c(0.9,0.1). Default c(0.5,0.5).}

\item{paired_reads}{Boolean: are the reads paired-end? Default TRUE.}

\item{adjust_method.}{See invertyper() for more details. Default "deltas".}
}
